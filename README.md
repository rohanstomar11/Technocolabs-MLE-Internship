## Project
Crowdfunding is the practice of funding a project or venture by raising monetary contributions from many people. Today, most crowdfunding happens online through various websites and Kickstarter is one of the world's largest crowdfunding platforms. Kickstarter is mainly focused on creativity-related projects, in particular in art, music, and design. It helps creators to find the resources and support they need to make their projects come real. Kickstarter is a huge global community; 16 million people have brought their contribution to over 150,000 successful projects all over the world.

Our objective is therefore to deploy a model which predicts the success of a Kickstarter project.
